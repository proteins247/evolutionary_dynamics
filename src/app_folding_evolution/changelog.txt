# Changelog for folding_evolution
## [0.0.11] - 2019-03-26
### Changed
- Fitness function based on protein output extrapolation.
- Requires latPack/1.9.1-15 or greater (but not enforced)
- Fitness function is purely linear (no x / x0 + x transformation)

## [0.0.10] - 2019-03-17
### Added
- `folding_evolution` will check during checkpoint resume that the same
  latPack version is being used via `LATPACK_SHARE` environment variable.
### Changed
- Use latFoldVec executable and LATPACK_SHARE environment variable of
  calling environment (instead of absolute paths).
- Switch back to always saving conformations in latFoldVec.
- Minimum fitness is now 1e-4 (0.0001) instead of 1e-3.

## [0.0.9] - 2019-03-08
### Changed
- New fitness function based on "output" of protein
- `folded_fraction` -> `protein_output`
- Use (requires) latpack/1.9.1-13
### Fixed
- Wrong 'old evaluations' logged for generation 0. It should be 0.

## [0.0.8] - 2019-02-19
### Changed
- Constant posttranslation time regardless of degradation param.
- Use latPack version 1.9.1-12
- --new-ngens to set new target generations on checkpoint resume.

## [0.0.7] - 2019-02-18
### Changed
- Further revisions of fitness function:
- 0.0.7-1: Exponential w.r.t. Pnat; binary degradation
- 0.0.7-2: Exponential w.r.t. Pnat; continuous degradation
- 0.0.7-3: Linear w.r.t. Pnat; continuous degradation 

## [0.0.6] - 2019-02-17
### Changed
- Fitness function revised to include P_nat
- Use latPack version 1.9.1-11

## [0.0.5] - 2019-01-17
### Added
- New option --instant-release
### Changed
- Simulation stops after N_GENS is reached and evaluated, not before
- LatFoldVec output frequency parameter set to 5000 from 10000
- "n gens without mutation" renamed to "n gens without accept"
- Checkpoint interval is 10 instead of 20
### Fixed
- Calculation of number of old evaluations for current generation was
  off by one generation worth of evaluations

## [0.0.4] - 2018-12-31
### Added
- Checkpointing of simulation state for resuming after crash.
### Changed
- Option to save conformations, named save-conformations
- In JSON log, also save folded conformation
- Use latpack/1.9.1-9, which defaults to overwriting hdf5 output.
### Fixed
- Correct value of total_translation_steps used for reevaluation
- Folding before ribosome release is now properly treated as folded
- json log count of old evaluations

## [0.0.3a] - 2018-11-18
### Changed
- Default to not saving structures (still saving energies)

## [0.0.3] - 2018-11-12
### Added
- Intermediate saves of JSON-format simulation log
- Attempts to wait for file directory creation
### Changed
- More data in JSON-format simulation log
### Fixed
- degradation_param

## [0.0.2] - 2018-10-27
### Added
- JSON-format simulation log
